# random-wallpaper-with-widgets
This Chrome extension transforms the New Tab page into a dynamic and personalized space. It offers a variety of widgets that enhance both functionality and aesthetics, making the browsing experience more enjoyable and efficient.

The core feature of the extension is the **Random Wallpaper Generator**, which pulls high-quality 4K images from Lorem Picsum to serve as the background for each new tab. This feature ensures that every time you open a new tab, you’re greeted with a fresh and beautiful wallpaper, adding a sense of inspiration and variety to your browsing.

Additionally, the extension features a **Digital Clock** with a modern UI, displaying the time in a clean **HH:MM:SS AM/PM IST** format. The clock includes a stylish gradient background and subtle shadow effects for a sleek, aesthetic look. The time is updated every second, ensuring accuracy and offering a minimalist, yet functional, design.

For organizational needs, the extension includes a **Task List** widget where users can add and remove tasks. This feature syncs with the browser’s local storage, ensuring tasks persist even after the tab is closed. 

Finally, a **Calendar** widget is available, showing the current month, days of the week, and marking today's date. The calendar's design is simple and clean, providing an intuitive way to keep track of important dates.

Together, these widgets create a stylish and productive environment right on your New Tab page.
